I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Analog and Mixed-signal circuit design, analog design automation and VLSI circuit design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.Xiyuan Tang of [PRIME Lab](https://tangresearch.top) from [School of Integrated Circuit](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
